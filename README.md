# Project 16 (HotProspects)

Project 16 in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)) guided us through the creation of the HotProspects app. Along the way we were introduced to custom environment objects, TabView, Result, objectWillChange, generating QR codes, and sending user notifications.
