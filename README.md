# Project 16 (HotProspects)

Project 16 in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)) guided us through the creation of the HotProspects app. Along the way we were introduced to custom environment objects, TabView, Result, objectWillChange, generating QR codes, and sending user notifications. We also looked at context menus, filter() and map() to customise List views, and using Swift package dependencies.

Challenge 1 was to add an indicator (a small envelope following the name in my case) to entries on the Everyone tab marked as having been contacted.

In challenge 2 we were required to change the storage location from UserDefaults to the document directory.

Challenge 3 required us to add an action sheet to allow the user to choose whether to order prospects either by name or most recent addition.
